    "# Final project proposal form\n",
    "\n",
    "## PHYS 5070, Spring 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "This form is for description of your plans for the final project this semester.  The final projects have to be (obviously) Python-based coding projects that solve some physics-related problem.  This could be a simulation of an interesting system, programming a microcontroller for your lab, or detailed analysis of some physics data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(_Note:_ if you work with data, I want to see more than pure data analysis - some kind of simulation, use of machine learning, etc.  The point is to make sure the project is a test of your overall programming ability; pure statistical analysis is a bit too narrow.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you to find research-related project ideas if at all possible, but that isn't required - just studying a physics problem is good enough.  This is also a _programming_ project, and not a research project - the code has to be novel and written by you, but the physics doesn't have to be completely novel.  For example, a project with the goal of reproducing the results of a published research paper would be completely acceptable (as long as the paper didn't provide the code and you're just following along!)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Final projects will be submitted as GitHub repositories.__  For team projects in particular, it's important to work in the repository so that I can see individual commits to get an idea of who contributed what code.  I will check to make sure the commits are at least roughly balanced - a heavily unbalanced work history will require further explanation to earn equal grades for the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working in a team, __only one proposal per team__ is necessary.  As noted below, __the maximum team size is three (3) students.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "All final projects will be graded on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Python coding: 40%__\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the code work as intended?  Are there bugs or edge cases that have not been dealt with?  Does the project demonstrate the ability to use Python to solve problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Test suite: 20%__\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a _clearly-labeled_ Python script or notebook containing tests for the main code base?  Do the tests all pass?  Are the tests non-trivial and comparing to known results (not just code to code?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Documentation: 10%__\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the code well-documented?  Documentation includes, but is not limited to: descriptive variable names, docstrings for functions, and a README file for the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Physics results and presentation: 30%__\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the project achieve the goals described in the proposal, or at least make significant progress towards them?  Is the presentation clear and understandable, with effective use of plots and descriptive text?"
